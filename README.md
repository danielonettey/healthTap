# healthTap
This is a final project for software engineering class where people have the liberty to use NFC to transfer their health data from one phone to another after the phones tap each other. This is to help users carry their health details around and be well prepared in terms of emergencies 

# TECHNOLOGIES
Flutter: The application was built with a cross-platform framework - flutter. Flutter was used because it allows for one codebase to be used on both android and ios devices hence, making development faster. Also, in terms of performance, flutter offers one of the best performance for mobile application development making it very suitable for a health project like ours.

Hive: Hive is a lightweight key-value pair database that we used to store data locally on the user's device. It also offers good performance and has a small runtime making accesses to information from it fast. The choice of Hive as our technology for local storage was based on the fact that retrieving a user's health data in case of an emergency is an operation which cannot be delayed.
